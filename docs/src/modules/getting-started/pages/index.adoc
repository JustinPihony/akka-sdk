= Getting Started

Start with a guided tutorial or explore working samples. The resources below help you learn by building services and agents with Akka.

== Tutorials

These hands-on tutorials walk you step by step through building real Akka systems, from your first minimal service to fully featured applications like shopping carts and AI agents. Each tutorial includes guided instructions, runnable code, and explanations of key concepts.

=== Build your first service

[TIP]
====
*New to Akka? Start here.*

Interactions with OpenAI LLM using the OpenAI Java SDK and a workflow. | link:https://github.com/akka-samples/medical-tagging-agent[Github Repository] | Intermediate
| AI agent that creates release notes summaries, every time there is a release from set up GitHub repositories. Interactions with Anthropic Claude is using the Anthropic Java SDK. Using tools to retrieve detailed information from GitHub. Entities are used for storing release summaries. Timed action looks for new releases periodically and creates the summary using the LLM. | link:https://github.com/akka-samples/changelog-agent[Github Repository] | Intermediate
| The real-estate customer service agent is demonstrating how to combine Akka features with an LLM model. It illustrates an agentic workflow for customer service. It processes incoming real-estate inquiries, analyzes the content to extract details, provides follow-up when needed and saves the collected information for future reference. | link:https://github.com/akka-samples/real-estate-cs-agent[Github Repository] | Intermediate
